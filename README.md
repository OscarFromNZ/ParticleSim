The building blocks of this universe will be neutrons and protons.
I would love to make them be quarks but I think I could easily spend a year on that and still fail.
I think this way is better evne if I have to hardcode some things.
And honestly I think I'd have to hardcode some things anyway for some reason. Such as the 4 forces that I still don't understand exactly why they exist.

Surely there must be just a few principles that everything is defined from, or even none but it simply works


NOTE: this universe is going to be 2d for simplicity
Actually nevermind, just for fun I'm going to do 3d
